        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            Many small home businesses, especially for some POC-owned restaurants, lack a functioning website, raising questions about customer
            experience and operational efficiency.  Menu design significantly impacts restaurant profitability 
            <a href="https://journal.binus.ac.id/index.php/JBSE/article/view/207">(Fikri & Ramadhan, 2011)</a>.  
            Reflecting on your own experiences, does a static PDF menu affect your dining interest?  Do you wish to personalize dish flavors, 
            such as reducing spiciness?  Additionally, have you faced challenges with restaurant reservations due to communication issues?
            An information technology problem for the restaurant we chose is that currently they do not have a website, so people
            cannot easily access their menu, order from online, reserve seats online, or have a good platform for asking the
            restaurant questions. Many restaurants will benefit from an accessible website, because aside from their physical
            building, it is hard to make information accessible to everyone. People will also benefit if they are in the restaurant
            but want an online menu to better search for menu items, or use a screen reader to look at the menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some existing attempts to solve this problem. Some restaurants apply web features such as online ordering and menu browsing which 
            enable customers to have a fictionless experience with the restarurant. For instance, <a href="https://www.purplecafe.com">The Purple</a>, 
            the cafe and wine bar have a website which provide a comprehensive solution for it to showcase its menu items, accept online order for pickup 
            and delivery and manage reservations. However, some crucial features such as real-time chatbox and dine-in ordering are not accessible. 
            By enabling customers to order online even for in-store dining, we can cater to changing consumer preferences and accommodate various dining preferences seamlessly.
             Additionally, we propose integrating a chat box feature into the restaurant website that enables real-time communication.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The application will primarily serve the restaurant's customers, which will enhance business visibility and facilitate access to information that can increase consumption and interest in Asian cuisine locally. Optimizing the communication of information for this type of establishment in a predominantly white city like Snoqualmie could be particularly meaningful in supporting POC-owned restaurants and enriching the cultural diversity of the region. The users will primarily use the web app to pick and customize their orders from a set of order options. Most of the interactive features of the web app will be integrated into its customizable online order service, which will enable customers to add or omit ingredients from an order based on their preferences (e.g., add an egg, pick a spice level from 1 to 5 stars), as well as basic items (e.g., a strawberry milk jug) online to pick up. The web app will also include a reservation page that displays a calendar and time slots for a date when clicked on. Furthermore, we would like to integrate a working QR code with our web page to direct users to our site for mobile deployment if feasible. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The users will primarily interact with the web page by viewing various order options and filtering them based on their personal preferences for their orders. The app currently redirects users to a basic Facebook page that merely shows the menu as a simple PDF, which limits user interaction and does not communicate the restaurantâ€™s information in a centralized, efficient, and user-friendly manner. Enhancing the accessibility and user-friendliness in communicating this information can boost online visibility, brand-building, and the representation of Asian cuisine in the area.
