        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest
                </li>
                <p>
                    Overview: Development of a web application intended to support small home businesses, with a focus on enhancing visibility and accessibility for POC-owned restaurants
                    <ul>
                        <li>How does a static PDF menu affect your interest in dining there? (Menu design is a key factor for the profitability of a restaurant <a href="https://journal.binus.ac.id/index.php/JBSE/article/view/207">(Fikri & Ramadhan, 2011)</a>)</li>
                        <li>Have you ever encountered a situation where you enjoyed a dish but wished you could personalize its flavor to better suit your preferences? For instance, finding Asian cuisine too spicy and want to adjust the spice level.</li>
                        <li>Have you ever faced difficulties with restaurant reservations, particularly when online platforms don't offer reservation options and communication via phone calls proves challenging?</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <li>
                    Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")
                </li>
            </ol>
                In short: let us know what you are interested in, and identify a problem that you think needs solving (and that might be amenable to a technological intervention) while also considering what has come before.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The application will primarily serve the restaurant's customers, which will enhance business visibility and facilitate access to information that can increase consumption and interest in Asian cuisine locally. Optimizing the communication of information for this type of establishment in a predominantly white city like Snoqualmie could be particularly meaningful in supporting POC-owned restaurants and enriching the cultural diversity of the region. The users will primarily use the web app to pick and customize their orders from a set of order options. Most of the interactive features of the web app will be integrated into its customizable online order service, which will enable customers to add or omit ingredients from an order based on their preferences (e.g., add an egg, pick a spice level from 1 to 5 stars), as well as basic items (e.g., a strawberry milk jug) online to pick up. The web app will also include a reservation page that displays a calendar and time slots for a date when clicked on. Furthermore, we would like to integrate a working QR code with our web page to direct users to our site for mobile deployment if feasible. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The users will primarily interact with the web page by viewing various order options and filtering them based on their personal preferences for their orders. The app currently redirects users to a basic Facebook page that merely shows the menu as a simple PDF, which limits user interaction and does not communicate the restaurantâ€™s information in a centralized, efficient, and user-friendly manner. Enhancing the accessibility and user-friendliness in communicating this information can boost online visibility, brand-building, and the representation of Asian cuisine in the area.
