        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")
                </li>
            </ol>
                In short: let us know what you are interested in, and identify a problem that you think needs solving (and that might be amenable to a technological intervention) while also considering what has come before.

        <h2>Problem:</h2>
        <p>
            While social injustices are the problems most worth attacking, your project could also address smaller, or more personal "problems". What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app might be able to help with?
            This description should be 1-2 paragraphs (~150-250 words) in length. Your overview should explain "what" the problem is and "why" it needs addressing (including why any currently existing apps are insufficient). You will need to include references to other resources to help clarify your explanation of this problem.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The application will primarily serve the restaurant's customers, which will enhance business visibility and facilitate access to information that can increase consumption and interest in Asian cuisine locally. Optimizing the communication of information for this type of establishment in a predominantly white city like Snoqualmie could be particularly meaningful in supporting POC-owned restaurants and enriching the cultural diversity of the region. The users will primarily use the web app to pick and customize their orders from a set of order options. Most of the interactive features of the web app will be integrated into its customizable online order service, which will enable customers to add or omit ingredients from an order based on their preferences (e.g., add an egg, pick a spice level from 1 to 5 stars), as well as basic items (e.g., a strawberry milk jug) online to pick up. The web app will also include a reservation page that displays a calendar and time slots for a date when clicked on. Furthermore, we would like to integrate a working QR code with our web page to direct users to our site for mobile deployment if feasible. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The users will primarily interact with the web page by viewing various order options and filtering them based on their personal preferences for their orders. The app currently redirects users to a basic Facebook page that merely shows the menu as a simple PDF, which limits user interaction and does not communicate the restaurantâ€™s information in a centralized, efficient, and user-friendly manner. Enhancing the accessibility and user-friendliness in communicating this information can boost online visibility, brand-building, and the representation of Asian cuisine in the area.

    Web Page Requirements (delete when finished)
    You should present the above information (Problem Description and App Description) in the form of a basic web page implemented with HTML and CSS. Create a new proposal.html file in the root of your project repo. This web page should include the following content:
    
    An appropriate page structure (including a <head> element with a <title>). The basic web page templateLinks to an external site. is a good place to start.
    
    A <header> containing a title for your page as a top-level heading (<h1>).
    
    Different <section> elements for each major part of your page (e.g., Problem Description, Proposed Application). Note that a functionality walkthrough would be appropriate as a "subsection" (e.g., a <section> within a <section>).
    
    Use appropriate HTML elements to semantically organize the content. For example, you might describe the different interactions a user can perform using an unordered list.
    
    Include hyperlinks to at least two (2) outside resources, references, or data sets related to your topic. These can be links to other applications in the same problem space. If you'll be using an existing data set, be sure to link to that!
    
    You will need to include some CSS styling. Create a new css folder inside of your repo, and a new proposal.css file inside of that folder. The styling can be whatever you want (change the font, background, etc), but you should include at least two (2) rules that change at least three (3) different properties total.
    
    Adding some spacing around the content is a great use of CSS.
